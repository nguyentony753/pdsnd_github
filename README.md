Update Information Follow-up Project 3. 



## Overview
In this project, I will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I will write a code import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing <b>descriptive statistics</b>.

Also, I'm also learning write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, i'll require the following softwares:

1. Use the project workspace environment on udacity and download the *.py version after completion
2. A text editor, I have installed and used Sublime and save file format *.mb

## The Datasets
The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:

- Start Time
- End Time
- Trip Duration
- Start Station
- End Station
- UserType

In addition, in 2 data sources from The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year

## I would like to give some personal opinions that I can ask myself a few questions to answer:
Through writing code, I'm able to answer the following questions about the bike share data:
1. What are the counts of gender?
2. What is the most common trip (i.e., the combination of start station and end station that happens the most often)?
3. What is the earliest birth year, most recent birth year, and most common birth year?
4. What are the counts of each user type?
5. What month occurs most often in the start time?
6. What day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) occurs most often in the start time?
7. What hour of the day occurs most often in the start time?
